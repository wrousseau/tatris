tatris
======

A very basic and not well written Tetris clone made using Qt. Playable though.
Developed with Simon Manchel for ENSTA Paristech's IN204 (object oriented programming module). Please note that this was 
our first Qt project and that it is not optimized, nore well organized. I might remake it one day because it was fun.

Playable though !
